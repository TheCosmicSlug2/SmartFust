Smarfust is a way to easily create menus to interact with in a game.

There are two ways to use smartfust:

1 - In mainloop mode (there will be only smartfust widgets, no way to create other interactions on the side)
2 - In update mode (note : mainloop mode uses update mode)

In update mode, the pygame screen is shared beetween the main program (your game for example) and smartfust

- You can define a list of widgets that smartfust will make appear (for example : )

dic = {
    2: sf.Checkbox((100, 220), (50, 50), colors=[(0, 150, 150), (150, 150, 0)], borders=[3]),
    3: sf.Entry((100, 300), (200, 30), inner_text="click here to change"),
    5: sf.Slider((400, 300), (100, 30)),
    6: sf.List((400, 100), (100, 30))
}


- then create the pygame screen :

screen = pg.diplay.set_mode(blabla)

- then create the smartfust screen :

sf_screen = sf.Diplay(screen)


- and in your code, do :

def main():
  # Your Game code
  while game_running :
    # your game logic

    sf_display.update()
    
    # the reste of your game logic
    pg.diplay.flip()
    clock.tick(30)

note : sf_display.update will NOT flip the screen, it will only create a cache surface will all the widgets, 
then blit this surface on the screen (again, without flipping the screen).
So if you create a non-transparent background for the sf_display, then calling sf_display.update() will hide all the things you could have drawn on screen prior, so it's best to call sf_display.update() before drawing anything on the screen, so it won't be hidden.



So why not only use "update" and not "mainloop" ?
Because, if you just want a menu that closes before the real game, there's no need creating a complex
loop to handle screen flipping, event catching, etc.

You can just :

widgets_list = [...]
def main():
  sf_display = sf.Display(dims=(400, 400))
  sf.display.add_widgets(widgets_list)
  sf.diplay.mainloop()

And the job is done !

note : this time : mainloop() WILL update the screen, it will basically do everything



You can also use smartfust for printing game data on the screen during the game, like FPS and stuff
For this, you need to update the widgets at each frame.



List of smartfust.diplay functions :

widget_values() # returns a dictionary of all the widgets and the value they currently have
set_font() # Set the font used by all the widgets
set_bg() # Set the background (rgb, custom, chessboard), also shadow type (sign, mult)
change_widget() # Change a widget's text
set_title() # Set window title
hide_widget() / hide_all_widgets()
show_widget() / show_all_widgets()
update()
mainloop()
